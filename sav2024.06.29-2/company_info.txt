### Our Awards and Ranking Results:
- We are in the TOP-20 outstaff developers in the prestigious Tagline ranking.
- We ranked 19th in the mobile application developers ranking in the prestigious Tagline ranking.

### BusinessMatika Provides the Following IT Services:
- Outstaffing
- Recruiting
- IT Specialist Leasing (trial period)

### What is IT Recruiting:
- We select IT specialists for subsequent employment in the client's staff.

### Conditions for Providing IT Recruiting Services:
- Our commission is usually 15% of the total annual fixed income of the candidate (before taxes) hired.
- 60-day guarantee for candidate replacement.
- We usually work with a 30% prepayment.
- We have special pricing conditions with many clients.


### Why Clients Should Seek Our IT Recruiting Services:
- According to our research, over 85% of large and medium-sized companies experience the following issues when hiring IT specialists:
  - The business often needs to fill IT vacancies "urgently". However, the internal HR department cannot do this faster than 2-4 months, and for some "difficult" positions, the search lasts 6 months or more.
  - Internal customers (hiring managers) from the IT department want to see 3-5 resumes relevant to their request to select the best candidates and regularly conduct interviews.
  - As a result, hiring managers receive few and infrequent candidates for consideration, leading to a sense of hopelessness (that they will "never" be able to fill the vacancy).
  - Many candidates who spent time on interviews and negotiations receive offers but decline them in favor of another company.
- We are experts in IT recruiting and understand the reasons for the difficulties in hiring IT specialists:
  - In-house recruiters at client companies are responsible for hiring all necessary employees, from cashiers to logistics directors.
  - The resources of the client's internal HR department are always limited, and their priority may not be directed towards IT.
  - The internal HR department does not always know how to work with effective channels for IT specialist recruitment: specialized groups, forums, and chats.
- Hiring IT specialists is a specific activity that requires special skills. However, most of our clients have told us that their internal HR department lacks the necessary expertise.
- What will happen if the client does not address the issues described above:
  - Our clients in retail and banking sectors tell us that business losses due to a shortage of IT personnel from the timely non-release of a product or an unfinished project average 1 million rubles per month. If you multiply this amount by the number of projects and the number of months of waiting, it becomes clear that their business losses amount to tens of millions of rubles each month.
  - The pronounced trend of IT specialist shortage emerged in 2020.
  - In 2022, this trend gained new momentum twice.
  - In our opinion, the situation will not fundamentally change in the next 2-3 years. This means that hiring IT specialists will only become more complicated.
- We have been professionally engaged in recruiting since 2012, and during this time, we have helped many well-known companies in Russia.
- Improvements you will see immediately after starting work with us:
  - We will significantly increase the flow of relevant candidates for consideration.
  - We will fill the "most urgent" vacancies within 2 weeks (the average time to close is 1 month).
  - We will move "stalled" vacancies from a deadlock: we will start showing candidates for rare vacancies that the client has been unable to fill for a long time.
  - As a result, we will give the client confidence that the problem of IT resource shortage has finally begun to be resolved.
- How we achieve great results for our clients:
  - Our recruiters have deep technical expertise, so they speak the candidates' language.
  - We have a team of specialized IT recruiters (with IT experience from 3 to 10 years).
  - We have our own candidate database with tens of thousands of resumes.
  - We conduct technical screening of candidates, and the recruiter sends the client a detailed cover letter with the CV.
  - We show the client only those candidates who are interested in the project and the client's company and who meet the hiring manager's hard and soft skills requirements.
- We work with any IT roles, any stack, trade, and industry experience.
- Most often, we have filled vacancies for the following project roles:
  - Frontend Developer
  - Backend Developer
  - Mobile Developer
  - Tester (manual and automated)
  - UX/UI Designer
  - Analyst (business and system)
  - Architect
  - Team Lead
  - Project Manager
  - Product Owner
  - DevOps
- When searching for candidates, we use the following sources:
  - LinkedIn
  - Facebook
  - HeadHunter
  - Habr Career
  - GitHub
  - VK
  - AmazingHiring
  - Telegram


### English Proficiency Level of Our IT Specialists:
- We select candidates based on the client's English language requirements.
- On average, the English proficiency level of our candidates ranges from B1 to C1.

### What is a Trial Period (Leasing IT Specialists):
- Leasing combines the advantages of IT outstaffing and IT recruiting, namely:
  - Quick deployment to the project,
  - Easy dismissal of the specialist if something goes wrong.
- This service is suitable for companies that want to hire a specialist on staff but first want to see how they perform in action.

### Which Jurisdictions Does Our Company Work With? Does Our Company Work with Foreign Clients or Partners?
- We work with clients both in Russia and those registered in any other jurisdiction.

### Citizenship and Location of Our IT Specialists:
- We predominantly offer IT specialists from Russia and Belarus.
- Less frequently, we offer specialists from CIS countries.
- Specialists of any citizenship work on projects for foreign companies.

### How Our IT Specialists Work on Client Projects (Remotely, Hybrid Format, In the Client's Office):
- Almost always remotely on the client's projects (the vast majority).
- Sometimes they work in a hybrid format with rare visits to the client's office (this option imposes many restrictions on the selection of a specialist with the required expertise within the client's budget).
- For office work, we select specialists only under the conditions of a trial period or within the framework of IT recruiting services.

### Advantages of Our Company for Clients:
- We can find any IT specialist the client needs:
  - Any project role,
  - Any stack,
  - Any grade,
  - Project experience in any industry,
  - Within the client's budget (if it matches the market).
- We have the necessary IT specialists for the client.
- If we do not have the required specialist, we will find them as quickly as possible.
- Three channels for finding specialists:
  - Our own staff,
  - Strong IT recruitment team,
  - Extensive partner network.
- Flexible pricing system. We select candidates within the client's budget.
- We quickly provide IT specialists with the necessary competencies. If the client searches for IT specialists with the necessary competencies independently, it takes 3 to 6 months.
- IT outstaffing saves money and time on searching, checking, and onboarding IT specialists.
- Intellectual property preservation: The results of the work always belong only to the client.
- Confidentiality: We always sign a non-disclosure agreement (NDA) with the client.
- Video interviews: Before approving an outstaffer for a project, the client has the opportunity to conduct a video interview with them.
- We provide specialists for short terms: We can provide outstaffing specialists for a period starting from 1 month.
- Quick response to the client's request: Within one business day, we respond to the client's request to confirm whether we can provide a specialist with the required competencies and knowledge for the client's project.

### Reasons Why Clients Typically Turn to Our Company for Help:
- Most outstaffing companies (our competitors) can only offer the client IT specialists who are available right now (on the bench).
- Therefore, when a client turns to our competitors for help, both conditions must be met:
  - The competitor has a specialist with the required skills and experience.
  - This specialist is not currently engaged in a project (on the bench).
- These two conditions are almost never met simultaneously. As a result, the client has to approach dozens or even hundreds of suppliers to "piecemeal" assemble the required project team.
- Such an approach to outstaffing companies is very labor-intensive, time-consuming, and can lead to significant financial losses.
- Therefore, clients turn to our company because we always have the necessary IT specialists. This allows the client to meet all their needs with a single supplier quickly and without much effort.


### Where Do We Get IT Specialists to Quickly Meet Client Needs:
- We have three channels for attracting specialists:
  - Our own IT specialists on staff,
  - Our partner network, which has over 400 partners and is constantly expanding,
  - IT recruiting - the most effective channel among the three listed.

### BusinessMatika's Core Expertise and Our Distinctions from Competitors:
- We have a huge selection of 1C specialists.
- We have a large pool of business analysts, system analysts, and business-system analysts. We fill such needs especially quickly.
- From the very founding of our company, we have developed our core expertise as follows:
  - We abandoned the development of niche industry expertise in the company, unlike similar companies in the IT market,
  - We abandoned the development of the company in a specific technology stack, as almost all other companies in the IT market do,
  - Instead, we focused on developing the following core expertise in the company:
    - Very fast and high-quality selection of IT specialists needed by the client, matching the individual requirements of the client,
    - Therefore, we can now meet the following needs:
      - Almost any project role,
      - Almost any stack,
      - Absolutely any grade,
      - Rate fitting the client's budget.
  - Therefore, all business processes in our company are structured in such a way as to meet practically any client needs as quickly as possible.

### What is IT Outstaffing?
- Outstaffing is when our company transfers its full-time IT specialist (or even an entire team) completely under the client's management.
- During this time, the specialist transferred to the client becomes indistinguishable from the client's regular employees.


### When Does a Client Need IT Outstaffing?
- The most typical case clients usually face is as follows:
  - The client has a project,
  - To implement this project, a project team is needed,
  - However, not all project roles in the client's team have the necessary employees on staff.
  - In this case, the client's core team members (team lead, PM, or Product Owner) are forced to start searching for people to fill the missing project roles.
  - Where does the client usually look for these missing specialists?
    - The first thing the client usually decides is to look on the open market.
      - However, the current job market is such that finding a suitable IT specialist in less than 3 months is practically impossible,
      - Meanwhile, the project has deadlines set by the "business",
      - Therefore, waiting 3 to 6 months for hiring is impossible because:
        - Project deadlines will be missed, leading to:
          - Significant financial losses for the client,
          - Possible termination of some project team members (those who did not meet the business goals).
      - Even if a specialist is hired quickly, other problems arise:
        - The specialist from the market turns out to be very expensive (since they were hired at any cost),
        - It's unclear what to do with this hired specialist after the project ends (if the stack they use is not planned to be used in future projects).
    - Therefore, the next logical step for the client to avoid all the difficulties and negative consequences described above is to hire the necessary specialist (or team) through outstaffing.
    - This solution allows the client to quickly recruit specialists for the missing project roles.
    - As a result, the project proceeds without the risks associated with a lack of specialists.
    - And the rented outstaff specialists do not become a burden for the company after the project ends:
      - They do not need to be artificially assigned work,
      - Their downtime does not need to be paid for,
      - They do not need to be fired.

### IT Outstaffing Compared to IT Outsourcing
- When a client hires an outsourcing contractor to implement their project, they "grow" the contractor's competence, not their own.
- At the end of the project, the contractor delivers the completed project but takes away the experience and expertise gained during the project's implementation.
- The problem is that today, having your own IT competence is:
  - A condition for survival in a competitive environment,
  - A key factor for business growth and development.
- Therefore, giving away expertise to a contractor is simply unacceptable in modern conditions.
- This is the main secret of the rapid growth of outstaffing as a service: this cooperation format helps businesses maintain and build their own IT expertise.

### IT Outstaffing Compared to Hiring Freelancers
- Outstaffing for the client, unlike hiring a freelancer, is:
  - A "company-to-company" (B2B) relationship, not "company-to-individual". A B2B contract saves the client from the following risks:
    - A freelancer may suddenly stop communicating, and the client cannot do anything about it,
    - A freelancer may simply not do the work or do it poorly and bear no responsibility to the client.
  - Transparent task and hour reporting according to corporate standards (Jira). When hiring freelancers, it is impossible to implement any corporate reporting standards.
  - Security. NDAs are signed between the client and the outstaffing service provider. A freelancer may simply steal the written code and bear no responsibility for it.
  - The outstaff specialist works full-time for the client, guaranteed not to be distracted by other projects (which is impossible to track when hiring a freelancer).


### Company Procedure for Working with New Clients:
- We hold a brief meeting where our specialists clarify questions necessary for an accurate understanding of the client's needs (briefing). Simultaneously, we start the process of negotiating and signing the contract and NDA.
- Within 1-2 days, we send the first CVs of candidates to the client.
- We maintain a funnel of 3-5 CVs under consideration at any given time.
- The client selects the preferred candidates, and we arrange interviews with them.
- Based on the interview results, the client decides whether to take a particular candidate for the project or to continue reviewing other candidates.
- Once the client decides that a candidate is suitable, we agree with the client on the candidate's start date.
- The specialist starts the project and works as long as the client requires.
- At the end of each month, we provide a report on the hours worked by the specialist, sign a certificate of completed work, and, according to the contract terms, the client pays for the actual hours worked by the specialists during that month.

### Timeline for Filling the Client's Vacancy (Need):
- Usually, finding a suitable specialist takes 1 to 3 weeks.
- We have a significant number of cases where we have met the client's needs within 48 and even 24 hours (from receiving the request to the specialist starting the project).
