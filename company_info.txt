### Reasons Why Clients Typically Turn to Our Company for Help:

- Limited Availability from Competitors:
  - Most outstaffing companies can only offer IT specialists who are currently available (on the bench).

- Challenging Conditions with Competitors:
  - Clients must meet both conditions when turning to competitors:
    - The competitor has a specialist with the required skills and experience.
    - This specialist is not currently engaged in a project (on the bench).

- Rare Simultaneous Fulfillment:
  - These two conditions are rarely met at the same time.
  - Clients often need to approach dozens or even hundreds of suppliers to piece together the required project team.

- Labor-Intensive and Costly:
  - This approach is labor-intensive, time-consuming, and can lead to significant financial losses.

- Why Clients Choose Us:
  - We always have the necessary IT specialists available.
  - Clients can meet all their needs with a single supplier quickly and with minimal effort.


### Where Do We Get IT Specialists to Quickly Meet Client Needs:

- Three Channels for Attracting Specialists:
  - Our Own IT Specialists on Staff: We have a team of in-house IT specialists ready to meet client needs.
  - Our Partner Network: Over 400 partners and constantly expanding.
  - IT Recruiting: The most effective channel among the three listed, allowing us to quickly find and attract the right specialists.


### Our Company's Core Expertise and Distinctions from Competitors:

- Extensive Selection of 1C Specialists:
  - We have a vast selection of 1C specialists.

- Large Pool of Analysts:
  - We have a large pool of business analysts, system analysts, and business-system analysts, allowing us to fill such needs especially quickly.

- Unique Development Approach:
  - From our founding, we focused on core expertise instead of niche industry expertise or specific technology stacks.
  - This allows us to provide:
    - Very fast and high-quality selection of IT specialists matching the client's individual requirements.
    - Ability to meet needs for:
      - Almost any project role,
      - Almost any stack,
      - Any grade level,
      - Rates fitting the client's budget.

- Optimized Business Processes:
  - All our business processes are structured to meet practically any client needs as quickly as possible.



### What is IT Outstaffing?
- Outstaffing is when our company transfers its full-time IT specialist (or even an entire team) completely under the client's management.
- During this time, the specialist transferred to the client becomes indistinguishable from the client's regular employees.



### When Does a Client Need IT Outstaffing?

- Typical Scenario:
  - The client has a project requiring a project team.
  - Not all project roles in the client's team are filled with the necessary employees on staff.
  - Core team members (team lead, PM, or Product Owner) need to find people to fill the missing roles.

- Challenges with the Open Market:
  - Search Time: Finding a suitable IT specialist in less than 3 months is practically impossible.
  - Project Deadlines: The project has deadlines set by the business, making a 3-6 month wait impractical.
    - Consequences of Delays:
      - Significant financial losses.
      - Possible termination of team members who did not meet business goals.
  - Cost and Post-Project Issues:
    - Specialists from the open market can be very expensive.
    - Uncertainty about what to do with the specialist after the project ends if their skills are not needed for future projects.

- Advantages of IT Outstaffing:
  - Quick Recruitment: Allows the client to quickly recruit specialists for the missing project roles.
  - Project Continuity: Ensures the project proceeds without risks associated with a lack of specialists.
  - Post-Project Flexibility:
    - Outstaffed specialists do not become a burden after the project ends.
    - No need to artificially assign them work, pay for downtime, or handle terminations.




### IT Outstaffing Compared to IT Outsourcing

- Outsourcing:
  - When a client hires an outsourcing contractor for a project, they "grow" the contractor's competence, not their own.
  - At the end of the project, the contractor delivers the completed work but retains the experience and expertise gained during implementation.

- Challenges with Outsourcing:
  - Having your own IT competence is essential for:
    - Survival in a competitive environment.
    - Business growth and development.
  - Giving away expertise to a contractor is unacceptable in modern conditions.

- Benefits of Outstaffing:
  - Helps businesses maintain and build their own IT expertise.
  - Enables clients to keep the knowledge and experience within their organization.
  - Supports the development of in-house competencies, ensuring long-term growth and competitiveness.



### IT Outstaffing Compared to Hiring Freelancers

- Business Relationship:
  - Outstaffing: A "company-to-company" (B2B) relationship.
  - Freelancers: A "company-to-individual" relationship.
  - B2B Contracts: Provide protection from risks such as:
    - Freelancers suddenly stopping communication.
    - Freelancers not completing work or doing it poorly without bearing responsibility.

- Reporting and Accountability:
  - Outstaffing: Transparent task and hour reporting according to corporate standards (e.g., Jira).
  - Freelancers: Difficult to implement any corporate reporting standards.

- Security:
  - Outstaffing: NDAs are signed between the client and the outstaffing service provider, ensuring code security.
  - Freelancers: Risk of code theft with no responsibility.

- Dedicated Work:
  - Outstaffing: Outstaff specialists work full-time for the client and are not distracted by other projects.
  - Freelancers: Impossible to track whether freelancers are fully dedicated to the client's project.


### Company Procedure for Working with New Clients:

- Initial Meeting:
  - Hold a brief meeting to clarify questions and accurately understand the client's needs (briefing).
  - Begin negotiating and signing the contract and NDA simultaneously.

- Candidate Presentation:
  - Within 1-2 days, send the first CVs of candidates to the client.
  - Maintain a funnel of 3-5 CVs under consideration at any given time.

- Client Selection:
  - The client selects preferred candidates and we arrange interviews with them.
  - Based on interview results, the client decides whether to take a particular candidate for the project or continue reviewing other candidates.

- Finalizing Selection:
  - Once the client selects a suitable candidate, agree on the candidate's start date.

- Project Commencement:
  - The specialist starts the project and works for the duration required by the client.

- Monthly Reporting and Payment:
  - At the end of each month, provide a report on the hours worked by the specialist.
  - Sign a certificate of completed work.
  - According to the contract terms, the client pays for the actual hours worked by the specialists during that month.



### Timeline for Filling the Client's Vacancy (Need):

- Typical Duration:
  - Finding a suitable specialist usually takes 1 to 3 weeks.

- Exceptional Cases:
  - We have many instances where we met the client's needs within 48 hours, and even as quickly as 24 hours, from receiving the request to the specialist starting the project.
